 # 🏍️ MotorbikeController

This is my first physics-based vehicle controller in Unity.  
It was made just for fun over a couple of days, so expect plenty of bugs (the wheelie system is an absolute 🎥).

## Features:
- A *"realistic"* `Wheelie` system with mass control, center of mass shifting, timing, and delay parameters.
- Torque, brake torque, friction, and stiffness management.
- Bike stabilization via `AddTorque` when tilted.
- Fully modular architecture using `readonly struct`, `Serializable class`, `MonoBehaviour`, and config wrappers.
- Could serve as a base for any Unity motorbike controller.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This controller is buggy, but it works 😁
